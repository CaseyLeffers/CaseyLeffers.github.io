#"Lifecycle of Software Objects"

"Would you have sex with a robot? Can mechanical thinkers have souls? These questions and many more are posed in Chiang's Lifecycle of Software objects, answering them with, for the most part, a resounding yes. Chiang's story follows two protagonists over there years after their lives intersect with a company called Blue Gamma, which produces a digital being known as digients. The digients are relatively helpless at first. Designed as pets that can think, grow, and bond with their owners, the two main characters, Derek and Ana, quickly find that the digients are immensely loveable, intelligent creatures. Ana bonds to her digient, Jax, at first in a way that I would relate to a hamster. Over time however, Jax’s intelligence and ability grows. Soon Ana, a former zookeeper, finds herself forming a tight bond with Jax. Her world is shaken when a griefer, bypassing security systems, releases a video torturing a digient. Ana believes unequivocally that while the digients are by no means human, they are equally sentient creatures, creatures now in need of protection. This marks a turning point in the story, as Ana begins to foster a relationship with Jax that is more akin to a mother and child, and like most mothers, Ana is desperate to protect her offspring. Derek, on the other hand, attempts to create distance between himself and his Digients after he views them as the reason for a failed relationship. While Ana is able to stick it out, Derek ends up selling one of his digients to a company that will redesign them for sex. Here the story provides few answers. Clearly, Chiang depicts the digients as sentient, and despite this, some of their owners are willing to sell them as sex toys. In the aftermath of this Ana decides that for Jax, she must, “as best she can, teach him the business of living.” To me, this points to the possibility of entire sovereign digient communities."
