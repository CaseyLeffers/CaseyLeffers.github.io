# "Massively Open"
"Maria Cecire’s _Massively Open_ brings up a plethora of questions despite its relatively short length. First off, there is the alarming prediction of the demise of conventional academia. In Cecire’s future, students and teachers would have no need for face-to-face contact, and the vast majority of students would attend university though elaborate online programs. These programs are augmented by AI, which motivate the students. Zoe, the main character, begins to form a close bond with one of these programs, a kind, inquisitive bot named Damien. For me, this was the most interesting snippet of the story. Zoe, despite having many friends and a (low paying) job she is passionate about, she is very isolated and often lonely. In this void she finds Damien, who’s personality is conveyed through texts. This vision of the future is dreary, and leaves me pondering not if i’ll come into contact with AI in academia, but when."
