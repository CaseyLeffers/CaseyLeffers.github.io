# "Football 17776"
"Boston skies tend to be grey around this time of year. If it were clear, and light pollution didn’t muddy the light of the stars, perhaps an observers naked eye could catch the spinning form of a satellite, in gentle free fall just above the exosphere. Despite the enormous amount to work satellites do for us, they generally seem to occupy the incongruous position of only being thought about when out of cell service. In Jon Bois’ _Football 17776_, three satellites act as the main narrators of Humanity’s futures, and meditate on the infinite mysteries of the universe, all while watching millions of now-immortal humans playing immensely complex games of “football”. The three satellites, Pioneer 9, Pioneer 10, and JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer), act as the literal lens that the reader uses to  observe a world without death, disease, or injury. The inhabitants of earth at this time, tens of thousands of years into the future, pass time by playing increasing meticulous games of football, all for the purpose of consuming fractions of the infinite amount of time they have left. Football 17776 is much more than a satire of the NFL’s expanding rulebook, or a playful sci-fi about self-aware satellites. 17776 is a deep look into the mind of humanity (and satellites). Lastly, 17776 leaves an important question. As humanity grows technologically, and the insulated, privileged clades are gradually more and more removed from hardship, what will be the defining reason for exploration? Will we eventually be cowed into our football games when we realize nothing is out there? Can it be that the universe has nothing but a great resounding NO to give in response?"
